### Feedback
- Would be useful to have a tutorial in plain Javascript, doing hackathons in typescript is painful
- A complete beginner friendly tutorial may be useful
- Smart contract deployment tools may be a useful link

- Enjoyed the emojis it made the docs look better
- Diagrams are useful and look good
- Would be useful to do a total tutorial in video for a hello world example
